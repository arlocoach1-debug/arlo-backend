    "source": "Journal of Applied Psychology (2020)",
    "summary": "Time blocking (scheduling specific activities in calendar blocks) increases training adherence by 40-50% compared to vague intentions. Treating training like non-negotiable meetings reduces decision fatigue and eliminates 'finding time' excuse. Morning training blocks have 80% completion rate vs 30% for 'whenever I can fit it in.'",
    "action": "Schedule training in calendar as recurring appointments. Block time including prep (changing clothes, commute) and recovery (shower, meal). Treat like important work meetings - non-negotiable. Best times: early morning (6-7am) before life interferes, or lunch break. Protect training blocks from encroachment."

    "topic": "Decision Fatigue & Simplification",
    "source": "Psychological Science (2021)",
    "summary": "Making decisions depletes mental energy, reducing willpower for training by 30-40%. Average person makes 35,000 decisions daily. Simplifying routine decisions (what to wear, eat, when to train) preserves mental energy for important choices. Successful athletes automate routine decisions through systems and habits.",
    "action": "Reduce daily decisions: 1) Train same time/place daily (no daily 'should I train?' decision), 2) Meal prep or eat similar meals (eliminates food decisions), 3) Lay out training gear night before, 4) Create morning routine (same sequence daily). Save mental energy for important decisions, automate everything else."

    "source": "Time Management Research (2020)",
    "summary": "Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill time available. Giving yourself 2 hours for 45-minute workout leads to procrastination and wasted time. Setting tight but realistic time constraints increases focus and efficiency by 30-40%. Time pressure (when appropriate) enhances focus and eliminates time-wasting.",
    "action": "Apply time constraints: Allocate specific time for training (60 min total including warm-up, workout, cool-down). Set phone timer. Stay focused - no phone scrolling between sets. Efficiency allows training to fit busy schedule without consuming entire day. Quality focused training > lengthy unfocused sessions."

    "source": "Harvard Business Review - Energy Management (2021)",
    "summary": "Managing energy more important than managing time. Everyone has same 24 hours but different energy levels throughout day. Physical energy (fitness, sleep), emotional energy (stress, mood), mental energy (focus, decision-making) all fluctuate. Schedule high-energy tasks during peak energy times, low-energy tasks during valleys.",
    "action": "Map your energy: Track when you feel most alert (often 2-4 hours after waking) and most drained (often mid-afternoon). Schedule: Hard training during peak physical energy, deep work during peak mental energy, admin tasks during low-energy periods. Don't schedule hard workout after exhausting workday. Honor your energy cycles."

    "topic": "Batching Similar Tasks",
    "source": "Journal of Organizational Behavior (2020)",
    "summary": "Task switching costs 40% productivity due to mental context switching. Batching similar tasks (all meal prep Sunday, all admin Friday afternoon) reduces switching costs and increases efficiency by 25-30%. Athletes who batch training-related tasks (meal prep, gear maintenance, planning) save 5-7 hours weekly.",
    "action": "Create batching routines: 1) Sunday meal prep (all meals for 3-4 days), 2) Weekly training planning (one session to plan entire week), 3) Batch errands (one trip covers multiple stops), 4) Batch emails (check 2-3× daily, not constantly). Group similar activities to reduce context switching and save mental energy."

    "topic": "The 2-Minute Rule",
    "source": "Behavioral Psychology Research (2021)",
    "summary": "If task takes under 2 minutes, do it immediately rather than adding to to-do list. Eliminates mental burden of remembering small tasks and prevents task accumulation. Starting is hardest part - committing to just 2 minutes often leads to completing entire task. Also useful for habit formation: start with 2-minute version.",
    "action": "Apply immediately: Email that takes 1 minute? Reply now. Dishes in sink? Wash now (under 2 min). For training habit: Commit to just 2 min (put on shoes, walk out door). Usually leads to full workout. Small tasks done immediately prevent overwhelm. Build momentum through immediate small actions."

    "topic": "Deep Work vs Shallow Work",
    "source": "Journal of Management Studies (2020)",
    "summary": "Deep work (focused, cognitively demanding tasks) produces most value but requires uninterrupted time. Shallow work (email, admin, meetings) feels busy but produces less value. Most people spend 60-80% time on shallow work. Protecting 2-4 hour deep work blocks increases productivity by 200-300%. Distractions destroy deep work.",
    "action": "Create deep work blocks: 1) Schedule 2-4 hour protected morning blocks for most important work, 2) Eliminate distractions (phone off, email closed, do not disturb), 3) Batch shallow work into afternoon blocks, 4) Communicate boundaries to colleagues. Same applies to training - focused quality training > distracted long sessions."

    "source": "Applied Cognitive Psychology (2021)",
    "summary": "Pomodoro technique (25 min focused work, 5 min break) maintains high focus by creating urgency and preventing burnout. Breaks restore attention span. Most people can sustain 25-40 min focus before attention degrades. Using timer creates accountability and prevents procrastination. Particularly useful for mentally demanding tasks.",
    "action": "For focused work: Set timer 25 minutes, work with full focus (no distractions), take 5 min break (stand, walk, stretch), repeat 3-4 cycles, take longer break (15-20 min). Useful for training too: focused interval session with structured work/rest vs. wandering aimlessly. Structured focus > unstructured time."

    "topic": "Morning Routine & Keystone Habits",
    "source": "Journal of Consumer Psychology (2020)",
    "summary": "Morning routine sets tone for entire day. Keystone habits (one habit that triggers others) create positive cascades. Morning workout increases healthy eating by 25%, productivity by 15%, and sleep quality by 20% through downstream effects. Controlling morning gives sense of control over entire day.",
    "action": "Build morning routine: 1) Wake same time daily (even weekends), 2) Immediate movement (5 min stretching or walk), 3) Hydrate (16-20oz water), 4) Quick breakfast, 5) Training session or deep work. Consistent morning routine becomes automatic within 3-4 weeks. Morning wins create momentum for rest of day."

    "topic": "Saying No & Protecting Priorities",
    "source": "Organizational Behavior Research (2021)",
    "summary": "Every 'yes' to something is 'no' to something else. Inability to say no leads to overcommitment, poor training consistency, and burnout. Successful athletes protect training time by declining competing demands. Clear priorities make saying no easier. Saying no to good things allows yes to great things.",
    "action": "Practice selective yes: Before committing, ask 'Does this support my top 3 priorities?' If no, decline politely. Scripts: 'I appreciate the invite but I'm focusing on training right now,' 'I can't commit to that and give it the attention it deserves.' Protect training blocks - they're investment in health and performance. No guilt."

    "source": "Journal of Applied Psychology (2020)",
    "summary": "Weekly review (reflecting on past week, planning next week) increases goal achievement by 30-40% and reduces stress by providing sense of control. Reviewing progress maintains motivation. Planning week in advance eliminates daily planning decisions. Successful athletes rarely 'wing it' - they plan systematically.",
    "action": "Sunday evening review (20-30 min): 1) Review last week (training completed, what went well/poorly), 2) Plan next week's training (schedule specific sessions), 3) Identify potential obstacles (travel, long workdays) and plan solutions, 4) Set 2-3 key priorities for week. Weekly planning allows daily execution without decision fatigue."

    "summary": "Average person checks phone 96 times daily (every 10 minutes). Phone use fragments attention and reduces productivity by 40-50%. Notifications trigger dopamine hits that erode focus capacity. Athletes who limit phone use show 20-30% better training consistency. Digital distractions are biggest modern productivity killer.",
    "action": "Digital boundaries: 1) Phone on airplane mode during training, 2) No phone first 60 min after waking or last 60 min before bed, 3) Delete social media apps (use desktop only), 4) Turn off all notifications except calls/texts from key contacts, 5) Batch phone time (3× daily, 15 min each). Protect focus like precious resource it is."

    "topic": "Accountability Systems",
    "source": "Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology (2020)",
    "summary": "External accountability increases follow-through by 65-95%. Public commitment, training partners, or coaches create social pressure that overrides individual motivation fluctuations. Tracking progress (logging workouts) creates self-accountability. Combination of self-monitoring + external accountability most effective.",
    "action": "Build accountability: 1) Training partner (scheduled sessions together), 2) Public commitment (tell friends/family your goal), 3) Coach or online community, 4) Daily workout logging (X calendar - don't break chain). Share progress weekly with accountability partner. Social pressure (used positively) beats willpower alone."

    "summary": "Average person wastes 2-3 hours daily on low-value activities (excessive social media, aimless browsing, TV background noise, unnecessary meetings). Auditing time use reveals shocking waste. Recovering just 1 hour daily provides 365 hours yearly - equivalent to 9 weeks of 40-hour work. Small leaks sink big ships.",
    "action": "Time audit: Track everything for 3 days (use app or notebook). Identify time wasters. Common culprits: social media (limit 30 min daily), TV (choose intentionally, don't default), meetings (decline non-essential), commute (audiobooks/podcasts). Redirect reclaimed time to training, sleep, or deep work. Audit quarterly."

    "topic": "Work-Life-Training Balance",
    "source": "Journal of Occupational Health Psychology (2020)",
    "summary": "Perfect balance is myth - it's dynamic tension requiring constant adjustment. Peak training volume requires sacrificing some social commitments. Work busy periods may require reduced training. Successful athletes think in seasons: heavy training blocks require saying no to social events, recovery periods allow more social time. Flexibility prevents burnout.",
    "action": "Think in seasons: Training hard for marathon? Reduce social commitments for 12-16 weeks, then prioritize relationships during recovery phase. Work busy season? Maintain base fitness (3-4 days weekly), plan big training block after deadline passes. Communicate with partner/family about current priorities. Nothing is permanent - adjust based on current season."
